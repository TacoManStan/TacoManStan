Spencer Cox is a lifetime software developer and engineer specializing in abstract framework design, high-level efficiency, modular applications, and game development.

His lifetime interest in computer science began at the age of 6 when he was introduced to LEGO Mindstorms, a LEGO product that adds electronic support, allowing users to build and program robots built entirely out of LEGOs.

At the age of 7, Spencer wrote his first basic website using HTML and rudimentary CSS.

At age 11, Spencer was introduced to the TI-83 calculator. He quickly discovered that programs could be written directly on the calculator, and wrote a simple RPG where the user was a PI symbol.
The calculator RPG supported multiple rooms, shops, weapons, a variety of stats for both the player and enemies, and real-time combat.
The game quickly spread around the entire school, with large numbers of students ignoring lectures and instead starting at their calculators.
Spencer was promptly suspended.

At the age of 14, Spencer was introduced to Java by a close friend. He quickly fell in love with more powerful languages and explored OOP theory.
Before long, Spencer wrote his first basic 2D game engine with the Java Swing framework.

Throughout his high school years, Spencer became deeply involved with the StarCraft 2 community, eventually discovering the Galaxy editor and StarCraft II Arcade Games.
In just 2 months, Spencer became a lead moderator of the most popular StarCraft 2 mapmaking community, SC2Mapster.com.
Spencer's primary project, named Explodeathon, became one of the top 20 most played arcade games, which lasted for several months.
Upon turning 17, Spencer switched his focus to a more monetizable goal, exploring Unity and Unreal game engines as well as other less popular options.
Eventually, Spencer came to the conclusion that he would rather develop a legitimate game engine from scratch.

Upon graduating from high school (at the age of 17), Spencer decided to forgo a college education and instead pursue his passion of developing software.

Upon moving into his first apartment, Spencer was introduced to the TRiBot RuneScape botting platform.
Spencer used his stock exchange knowledge to write an in-game "stock exchange" bot that automatically initiates and performs trades with other players, buying low and selling high.
Soon after, Spencer released and sold his bot, which quickly became the most profitable RuneScape bot available.
Spencer became increasingly involved with the TRiBot community and, due to the profits, decided to postpone his 2D Game Engine project.

Several years later, Spencer was contracted to rewrite the entire TRiBot client in JavaFX.

Another couple years later, Spencer decided to take a break from programming and pursue a temporary career as a personal trainer.
Spencer remained a successful personal trainer for 3 years.

At the age of 25, during the first year of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Spencer spent his time continuing and expanding his programming education.
Eventually, this led to his decision to finally write the Game Engine he has wanted to create since the age of 11.
After about 6 months of education and reeducation, Spencer finally began his work towards the end of 2021, at the age of 26.
Since then, Spencer has been focused entirely on his game engine, which is shown in this project.

While Spencer wants nothing more than to complete his passion project, Spencer wants nothing more than to be part of a passionate game development team for an existing project.
